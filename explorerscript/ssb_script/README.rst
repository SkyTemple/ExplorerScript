SSBScript
=========
SSBScript is a "variant" of ExplorerScript, which
is nearer to the original SSB binary format and thus
easier to convert into/from SSB binaries.

It is almost a subscript of ExplorerScript, but it has
special syntax for jumps not present in ExplorerScript.
Other than that it only supports the general
routine statements and regular operation
statements, even for statements that have special
syntax in ExplorerScript.

It is meant to be direct representation of a binaries SSB opcodes.
